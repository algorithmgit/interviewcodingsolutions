To generate 1 billion numbers in sequence efficiently, you can utilize multithreading to distribute the workload across multiple threads. Each thread can generate a portion of the sequence concurrently, utilizing the available CPU cores effectively. Here's a high-level design for such a system:

1. **Divide and Conquer Approach**: Divide the task of generating 1 billion numbers into smaller chunks and assign each chunk to a separate thread. Each thread will generate a portion of the sequence concurrently.

2. **Thread Pool**: Create a thread pool to manage and distribute the workload efficiently. The thread pool will consist of a fixed number of threads that are reused to generate numbers sequentially.

3. **Synchronization**: Ensure proper synchronization mechanisms to coordinate the threads and avoid race conditions. You may need to use synchronization primitives such as mutexes or atomic operations to ensure that the generated numbers are sequential and unique.

4. **Efficient Number Generation**: Implement an efficient algorithm for number generation. Depending on the requirements, you can choose from various algorithms such as linear congruential generators, Xorshift, or Mersenne Twister.

5. **Buffering**: Use buffering techniques to reduce contention and improve performance. Each thread can generate numbers in batches and store them in a buffer before writing them to the output.

6. **Output Handling**: Decide how the generated numbers will be handled. You can write them directly to a file, stream them to another process, or store them in memory for further processing.

Here's a simplified pseudocode to illustrate the approach:

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

# Function to generate numbers in a range and write them to a file
def generate_numbers(start, end, output_file):
    with open(output_file, 'a') as f:
        for i in range(start, end):
            f.write(str(i) + '\n')

def main():
    # Number of threads to use
    num_threads = 8
    chunk_size = 1_000_000  # Number of numbers to generate per thread
    
    # Create a thread pool
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=num_threads) as executor:
        # Submit tasks to generate numbers concurrently
        for i in range(0, 1_000_000_000, chunk_size):
            executor.submit(generate_numbers, i, i + chunk_size, 'output.txt')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This pseudocode creates a thread pool with 8 threads and submits tasks to generate numbers concurrently in chunks of 1 million. Each thread writes its generated numbers to the output file. Adjust the parameters according to your specific requirements and system capabilities. Additionally, ensure proper error handling, resource management, and performance optimization based on your implementation language and platform.
