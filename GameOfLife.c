Please read through all instructions thoroughly and let me know if you have any questions before you get started.

This editor *does* have vim/emacs binding support (at the bottom left, in Settings) if desired.

This task is called The Game of Life. You can use the Internet as long as you donâ€™t look up the answer, and you have 30 minutes to finish after I see you log in.

Initial board:
101100001001
000010001011
010011100000
100100111100
101110000011

 -> 0001...
 -> .1.....

Given a board with m by n cells, each cell has an initial state live (1) or dead (0). Out-of-bound cells should be considered dead (0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules:

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Most people copy/paste the board above into their code, then convert to a 2D array, adding commas.

Please have your program print out the next iteration of the board.
